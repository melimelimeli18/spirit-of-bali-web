            <h1>Bale Banjar</h1>
            <h3>The Social and Cultural Hall of the Community</h3>
            <p>Bale Banjar is the heart of Balinese village life. Functioning as a communal hall, it serves as the center for meetings, ceremonies, and rehearsals for gamelan or dance performances. Constructed with an open pavilion design, the Bale Banjar reflects the Balinese value of openness and togetherness, where community members gather to discuss, celebrate, and make decisions collectively.</p><br>
            <p>Architecturally simple yet meaningful, it embodies the spirit of democracy and cooperation that defines Balinese society. Without the Bale Banjar, many cultural traditions would not thrive, as it is the place where they are nurtured and sustained.</p>

            <h1>Bale Daja (Bale Meten)</h1>
            <h3>The Sacred Family Pavilion</h3>
            <p>Bale Daja, also known as Bale Meten, is one of the most important pavilions in a traditional Balinese house compound. Positioned in the northern area, it is dedicated to honored family members and sacred rituals. Traditionally, this pavilion also serves as a sleeping area for the head of the household or elder family members, symbolizing respect and hierarchy within the family structure.</p><br> 
            <p>Its design is rectangular with raised floors, open spaces, and carved wooden pillars, reflecting both practical function and spiritual symbolism. Bale Daja illustrates how Balinese architecture seamlessly integrates spirituality, family values, and daily living.</p>

            <h1>Candi Bentar</h1>
            <h3>The Splitting Gate of Balance</h3>
            <p>Candi Bentar, the iconic split gate of Bali, is more than an architectural marvelâ€”it is a philosophical statement. Found at temple entrances, palaces, or traditional compounds, the gate is divided into two symmetrical halves, symbolizing the concept of Rwa Bhineda, or duality in balance (good and evil, male and female, day and night).</p><br>
            <p>Walking through a Candi Bentar is not just entering a space; it is a symbolic passage from the outer, secular world into a sacred, spiritual realm. The gate's towering stone carvings, often adorned with intricate patterns, emphasize Bali's artistic mastery and religious devotion.</p>
