            <h1>Rindik</h1>
            <h3>The Gentle Melodies of Bamboo</h3>
            <p>Rindik is a traditional Balinese instrument made of bamboo tubes struck with mallets, producing soft, soothing tones that evoke a sense of peace and harmony. Often played in pairs or small ensembles, rindik is commonly performed at community gatherings, festivals, and weddings, creating a relaxed and joyful ambiance. Its gentle melodies provide the perfect background for social interaction, symbolizing hospitality and togetherness.</p><br>
            <p>Unlike the grandeur of gamelan, rindik is intimate and calming. It is sometimes accompanied by vocals or traditional dances such as the Joged Bumbung, a lively social dance. Through its simplicity and warmth, rindik represents the Balinese way of blending music into everyday life, turning ordinary moments into expressions of art and culture.</p>

            <h1>Kendang Bali</h1>
            <h3>The Pulse and Tempo Keeper</h3>
            <p>Kendang, the traditional Balinese drum, is the heartbeat of gamelan music. Played with both hands, the kendang controls tempo, cues transitions, and directs the flow of performances. It is the leader within the gamelan ensemble, guiding dancers, singers, and fellow musicians with its rhythms. The sound of kendang is sharp, commanding, and precise, bringing energy and structure to performances.</p><br> 
            <p>Beyond music, kendang holds ceremonial importance. It is played during religious rituals, processions, and traditional dances, symbolizing leadership and vitality. The kendang exemplifies the Balinese belief that rhythm and order are essential not only in music but also in life itself.</p>
