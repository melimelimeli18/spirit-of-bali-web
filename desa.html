          Tenganan Village is one of the oldest traditional villages in Bali,
          known as a Bali Aga village. It has preserved its unique customs,

          The village is most famous for its double ikat weaving called
          Gringsing, a textile that is believed to have spiritual power. The
          weaving process is highly complex and only practiced by the women of
          Tenganan, making it a cultural treasure of Bali.
        </p>

          such as the Mekare-kare or pandanus war, which attracts many visitors
          each year. These practices highlight the villagers' strong connection
          to their heritage and traditions.
